## Overview 
During the school year, children could come to our Makerspace after school to work on projects.

***

## Daily Workshops
Depending on the day of the week, students worked on projects based on specific topics and themes with varying degrees of instruction.

### 1. Coding
Makerspace students would create games and other programs in Scratch. They would watch a short tutorial on how to accomplish a certain task before creating their own projects where they were supposed to use the techniques featured in the tutorial. Often, the would have their own ideas for projects they wanted to make. Some students added on to large projects they were working on every week, while others started new ones. They mostly required assistance with implementing ideas too complicated for them to understand how to program, but some were uninterested in coding and needed help getting started. Either way, most of the students seemed to be having fun, and they learned a lot and progressed from week to week.

## Fridays
On Fridays, makers weren't constrained to a specific subject. The Makerspace had a lot of resources available for them to work on projects that interested them.

### 1. Types of Projects
Some students had things they were working on in storage. Every Friday, they would simply take them out and resume working on them. Others decided to start new projects using whatever materials they found interesting. Some students worked together on projects while others worked alone.

### 2. Types of Resources
The Makerspace had a laser cutter. Students would often take turns designing shapes to cut out, ranging from simple holiday cards and gifts to expansive 3D models that had to be constructed from many individual pieces. Students paid for materials such as wood if they couldn't find scraps. Other students made things out of cardboard and clay; other miscellaneous objects that could be used for projects included string, straws, and felt. Makers knew how to use tools like box cutters and hot glue guns.

### 3. Productivity and Management
Most students knew what they wanted to do, so they were reasonably productive. Sometimes they had to ask adults and teachers for help, so we went around making sure everyone was on task and helping them find things that interested them.
