## Coming Soon
We will be on-boarding contributors for the overall event topics, and then will turn our attention to using this playbook as a template that can be forked and used for your event.

## Help Wanted
If you are an Open Source wizard that is great with GitHub, we can use your help to get this process working! Find us in the Nation of Makers Slack #maker_event_playbook channel, or ping one of the [project collaborators](collaborators.html).
