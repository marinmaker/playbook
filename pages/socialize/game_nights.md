We've seen Game Nights happen at makerspaces where the focus is on spending time with your fellow makers just playing and having a good time. It might be board games or video games, but again, the focus is more of a social event than hands-on making, though there's a chance some maker will want to show off the board game accessories or DIY gaming cabinet they built.
