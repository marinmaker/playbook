Festivals come in all shapes and sizes, and some of them are of particular interest to the Maker Community. Fringe Festival immediately comes to mind as we've seen makers, artists, and other creatives from the Maker Community attend the events, and sometimes even get involved showing their work. Burning Man might be considered a festival, though it's a bit more than a local event you might check out on a typical weekend.
