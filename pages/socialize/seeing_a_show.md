Sometimes you just want to hang out with other makers and be entertained and/or informed (or both)! We all loved MythBusters (Hi Adam!) and after the show ended Jamie and Adam did tours with live shows. TEDx Talks are TED-style events that take place anywhere and everywhere, and celebrate locally-driven ideas. (We've even seen makers giving TEDx Talks.) Plenty of other shows and talks lean into the areas of interest to makers, in fact we know of at least one makerspace that has an open invitation to Nick Offerman to visit when he's in town for one of his shows.
