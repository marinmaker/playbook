Meetups (and specifically, **Maker Meetups**) tend to be organized public events where anyone and everyone who is interested in the topic (Making, in this case) is invited to take part. Meetups can be formal, or informal, and may include talks or presentations, or may lean towards being more social. Meetup topics run the gamut, and many groups who are trying to start a makerspace start the process by running a Maker Meetup.
