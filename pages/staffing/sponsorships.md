The sponsorship needs of your event will most likely be determined by the scale of your event. 

Sponsorship can be monetary or in-kind. The first is obviously money to help produce your event. This may consist of payment directly to your organization, or a sponsor directly paying for expenses related to your event. In-kind sponsorship can be just as valuable, providing services or products that will help you save money by not having to purchase or pay for things.

## Sponsor Recognition

Sponsor recognition can come in many forms, some include; social media posts tagging sponsor on the platform, logos/names on shirts, printed materials, signage, projected on walls, digital signage slides, announcementsâ€¦ posted in areas that sponsor is sponsoring... And of course, the sponsor wrap-up report. Perks for sponsors, in all the various forms.
